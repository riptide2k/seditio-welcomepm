Features :

This plugin will send a welcome PM to every new registered user.

Installation :

1 : Unpack the package on your computer and enter the title and the text of your welcome pm into the language file

2 : Upload the files into the folder : /plugins/welcomepm/

3 : Go into the administration panel, then tab "Plugins", click the name of the new plugin, and at bottom of the plugin properties, select "Install all".

4 : Some extended plugins have their own configuration entries, available by clicking the number near "Configuration" in the plugin properties, or go directly to the main configuration tab, section "Plugins".


Notes :

Remember to adjust the settings in the configuration panel :

- ID number of the sender, set 0 (zero) if you don't want replies.
- Name of the sender, set a non-existing name if you don't want replies.

The text for the PM is set in the language file, because it's more flexible this way.
